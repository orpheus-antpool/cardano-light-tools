# cardano-light-tools

This repository includes a set of lightweight tools to operate and maintain a Cardano Stake Pool.

For now, it includes a simple monitoring script that logs relevant metrics directly into a text file in human-readable form.
This can be used as portable (architecture-independent) alternative to Grafana that occupies a minimal memory footprint.
